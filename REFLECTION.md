## What did you learn about CI/CD this week?
   1. We learned how the product lifecycle looksâ€”what happens when we write code and deploy it to production.
   2. We also learned that using automation tools helps save time and prevents future problems.

## What challenges did you face in the pipeline?

   1. Understanding how to deploy and choose the right tools for the frontend app and backend server.

## How would you improve your current pipeline for a production-grade project?

   1. Create separate YAML files for small deployment jobs and combine them into one file for full deployment. <br />
      This way, I can choose to deploy only the backend, only the frontend, or both.
